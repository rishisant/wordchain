            Word Chain is a game about chaining words together. You are given a random
            <br>topic. Your goal is to type words related to that topic. However, the one catch
            <br>is that words must be chained together. This means the first letter of the new
            <br>word must be the same as the last letter of the preceding word.
            <br><br>
            For example, within the topic: countries, if you input "Brazil" as the first word,
            <br>your preceding word must start with an 'l'.
            <br><br>
            Each word has a certain power associated with it. Your goal is to diminish the power
            <br>meter from 100 to 0. Rarer letters correspond with higher powers. For example, 
            <br>the letter 'x' would have a higher power than the letter 'a'.
